                <p>Gunpla traces back to an anime from 1979, Mobile Suit Gundam. It's anime series with a deep plot revolving around a war for independence, with political and military themeings, and with character work akin to a soap opera. The characters piloted giant humanoid robots, with only some being designated as "Gundams." It reflects the horrors of war, and shows the main protagonist willingly being used as a child soldier to save himself and those he loves. With the emergence of this series, toys were created to compliment it. The series was a smash hit, a huge success. Unlike most other original works being made to produce toys, the toys only came after the passionate creator Yoshiyuki Tomino finished his masterpiece. They became a sensation, with accurate plastic modelling similar to the anime with a fun way to build them. It was like Lego with tools. The modern day evolution of Gunpla, meaning Gundam plastic models, is ongoing, with new kits having new dynamic pieces and intricate mechanics. Like Lego, it's an extremely fulfilling and satisfying hobby.</p>
